# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Renders on iOS. Both Apple platforms share one implementation under
  `darwin/`: the same Filament, the same Metal backend, the same
  CVPixelBuffer handed to Flutter's texture registry.
- `setup.sh` fetches the iOS SDK as well and packages a three-slice
  xcframework — macOS, iOS device, iOS simulator.
- Materials are compiled with `-p all` rather than `-p desktop`, so one
  compiled material serves both platforms.

## 0.1.0

- First cut of `orbis_filament`. Pre-alpha: everything is subject to change.
